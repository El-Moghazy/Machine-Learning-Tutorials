    <td> Project Description: Use SVM classifiers to classify Data of the Iris dataset. you will find the 
    Iris dataset in scikit learn datasets. You sould use all what you
    learned in the pase weeks like train-test splits, cross validation and grid-
    search to optimize the SVM classifier. Start the project using LinearSVC()
    and get the results then compare it with results from SVC() classifier and 
    try to illustrate which classifier is better and why.
    The Project should be written in Ipynp file and it must look like
    a professional tutorial like the ones in machine learning mastry.
    The test score must be very close 100 % </td>
