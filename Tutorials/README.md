<h1> Tutorials to fork and run on Kaggle servers for free </h1>
I believe Kaggle is one of the best ways to learn machine learning through competitions, So i made some Tutorials (kernels) using kaggle Notebooks. Kaggle Notebooks are free and much faster than an ordinary laptop as you may choose to use GPU accelerated (tesla k 80) for free

## Make an account and fork the notebooks. 
## If you like the Notebooks Upvote them Please.
